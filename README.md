## Introduction

[News API](https://newsapi.org/) is an amazing source of information as it provides a single API that exposes breaking news headlines and older articles from over 3,000 news sources and blogs!

You can [sign up here](https://newsapi.org/account) for a free developer plan which allows you to make 500 requests per day. One can easily exceed the limit

## Solution

This project queries the newsapi at a regular interval and logs the reponse to a JSON file.
This json file is then committed and pushed to github. Now one can get the latest news from this json instead of newsapi.

## Pros

- No API KEY needed
- No limit in number of requests

## Cons

- Cannot query for news (Can be fixed by cloning this repo and customizing according to your needs)
- Slightly delayed result (Can be reduced by reducing the query time interval to newsapi)
